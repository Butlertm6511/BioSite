                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have a passion for the health and wellness of people and have spent a great deal of my life trying to help people find solutions to various problems. I have a bachelor's in Exercise Physiology from Adams State College and a Physical Therapist Assistant Associate degree from Arapaho College. However, during the last few years, I decided to change careers and return to school for a master's in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning from Colorado States University. During this time, I also started a new job as a data analyst for Mind Springs. Mind Springs is a company that owns several mental health facilities in western Colorado.

                    Technology allows people to think out of the box. As a result, you can make a new solution to problems that people may have never thought about. My goal is to find a job where I can merge all my skills, like working with technologies that help people with disabilities. For example, developing programs that use A.I. and machine learning, such as exoskeletons, could give a person the ability to walk. Or in early detection and wearable devices that could monitor and save lives. A.I. allows for so many opportunities to do good things for people. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I believe I can make something unique by putting together the skills I have. I have health and wellness experience, helping people achieve fitness goals. In my 13 years in physical therapy, I worked hands-on with several people with multiple diagnoses in different settings, and now I am excited about what I can bring to the table with my new skills.
