                <br />
                <p>
                    I enjoy several hobbies, but my top three are traveling, health, and dirt bikes. I like doing them with my family and am really excited when we find new experiences. The world is so big, and there are several different things I would like to explore and experience  I would like to have.
                </p>
               <br />
               <p>For travel, one of my favorite places is Maroon Bell. Maroon Bells is located in the Elk Mountains and Maroon North Maroon Peak. They are two of Colorado's fourteeners. It received its name because it's shaped like a bell and the color when the light hits them sometimes looks maroon. It is so popular that buses are used to settle visitors from the visitor center to the mountain's base. Although it is beautiful all year, the best time of year would be in the fall when the leaves change into bright colors of red, yellow, and oranges. </p>

                <br />
                <br />
               
               <p> Dirt biking is a  new hobby in the beginner stage, but I really enjoy it. Fruita is next to several great paths; it is close to Rabit Valley, and a popular location is BML public lands which have many trails for every level of rider. Moab Is a place where I would like to ride. Because of the scenery. Some trails are Kokopelli Trail which starts in Loma, Colorado, and then spans into Utah. It is more challenging than my current level but one I would like to explore. Another is Onion Creek Road in Moab, Utah, which can be a more accessible trail.</p>
               <br />
               <p> Health is essential to me. I like cooking and making different things and going to the gym. I use a variety of exercise styles when working out, such as powerlifting and Olympic lifting. The difference between the two is in the lifts you perform. Squats, benches, and deadlifts are forms of power lifts. Snatch, clean, and jerk is forms of Olympic lifts. I prefer powerlifting.</p>
